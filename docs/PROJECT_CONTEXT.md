# Milana ERP: current working context

Updated 2026-10-24. Keep this file short: current decisions, release pointers and
unresolved risks. Detailed history belongs in [the archive](archive/README.md),
not appended here. This summary does not replace live release verification.

## Source and production

- Shared integration/production branch: clone_main. origin/main is stale for this work.
- Continue a suitable isolated worktree; preserve the legacy C:\ERP checkout.
  Use separate engineer work directories and one landing queue coordinated by Mirshoir.
- [DEPLOYMENT.md](../DEPLOYMENT.md) is the only supported release procedure.
  Before release reconcile Git, production-base.json, both manifests and runtime slots.
- Verified 2026-10-24 at 16:16 Tashkent: both VMs serve blue `20261024_093619`;
  retained healthy rollback is green `20261024_032622`. Deployed application commit
  `1fce86b5b9156fac050ca5c98433198323b20929`, manifest
  `e424f9a6f135b0ebf3851e0355c39d546bd3466eafcb4ddba6ef27c2b3bd4d31`;
  database remains `0148_second_grade_packages`. See [the deployment record](archive/SEWING_LATER_NASTIL_2026-10-24.md#production-activation--2026-10-24).
- The earlier `20261024_032622` deployment recorded an initial performance failure and rollback, followed
  by reactivation of the same images; public-path tail variation remains unresolved.
  The owner waived the timed observation period. The archive preserves all attempts.

## Later-Nastil Sewing fix deployed

- Permanent later-Nastil receipt/completion and assignment fix is implemented and tested for MIL/BST/ECO. Runtime candidate `1fce86b5`; immutable CI `40082616718` passed.
- Ismail merged PR #304 as `ec02b5f`; the owner explicitly accepted his merge as approval and authorized deployment without the 30-minute monitoring window. The tested immutable runtime has identical application/frontend/migration/CI files to that merged fix. Later service relocation `1dfd1c5d` remains outside this release; repository architecture below describes that newer branch state.
- Activated at 16:13 Tashkent. Fresh backup, no-op schema verification, renewed 18-check factory QA, real live browser checks, all four health checks, runtime/log/database/source/rollback checks and fixed-query paired/public performance budgets passed. No business records/history were repaired or replayed; all eight PO-0307 table fingerprints match across cutover. Timed monitoring was explicitly waived, not reported as performed. Operator business acceptance remains pending.
- [Detailed verification and release record](archive/SEWING_LATER_NASTIL_2026-10-24.md) preserves root cause, tests and deployment preparation.
- Owner-authorized historical reconciliation at 16:29 Tashkent: reviewed 44 pending
  Nastils and reopened 38 incorrectly completed Sewing work orders (MIL 33, BST 4,
  ECO 1) through the deployed service. All 38 now appear in their factory's active
  Sewing floor, restoring 19 missing Milana orders. Only status/end_time/update
  timestamps changed; 38 append-only audits record the prior completion times.
  Fresh backup, 41-table conservation/persisted checks, all 131,366 backup audit
  rows, factory API/browser checks and four health endpoints passed. Pending cuts
  and receipts were not approved or fabricated; ECO USL-0008 still has 335 pieces
  awaiting Cutting approval. PO-0307 remains correctly completed at 256 pieces.
  Runtime/rollback/schema are unchanged; see the archive's historical reconciliation.

## Architecture and migration state

- Keep the FastAPI/SQLAlchemy/PostgreSQL monolith. Router -> feature service ->
  SQLAlchemy schema models + Session -> database. No microservice/ORM replacement.
- Target: api/routes/ for HTTP, models/ for business services, schemas/ for
  database schema models, libs/dto/<feature>/ for input/update/output contracts,
  libs/enums/ for fixed vocabulary, libs/types/ for distinct internal contracts.
- Existing services now live in models/*_service.py; services/ was removed.
  The owner then authorized completing namespace separation urgently: the 22 DTO
  files are now in libs/dto/ and 26 SQLAlchemy definition files in schemas/, with
  all callers and ORM registration updated. Table definitions and business rules
  are unchanged. See the plan's verification record for actual checks/limitations.
- Twelve service-group directories remain guides for later approved extraction.
  Schema/DTO groups with implementations are active packages; mixed source files
  remain intact. Route business logic extraction has not started through this task.
- Humans decide business policy, interfaces and cutover; AI implements approved
  scope. Multitenancy is deferred. No deletion quota or table-per-service requirement.

## Work and ownership

- [Refactor plan](REFACTOR_PLAN.md): tasks/dependencies; [source map](REFACTOR_MAP.md):
  current files and proposed homes; [team ownership](TEAM_OWNERSHIP.md): exact assignments.
- Mirshoir: architecture, database integrity, production, packaging, fulfillment,
  release approval. Ismail reviews Mirshoir's changes.
- Ismail: catalog, purchasing, sales, inventory, planning, finance; DTO/enum/type
  conventions. Dilmurod: identity, people/payroll, tasks, shared platform and CI.
- Shavkat: business clarification, priorities and operator acceptance, not technical
  review or migrations. Each code change has an engineer and a separate reviewer.
- Use [active bugs](../bugs/bugs.md) for defects and [finished bugs](../bugs/finished_bugs.md)
  only after named human production verification. Refactoring tasks stay in the plan.
- Shared [skills](AGENT_SKILLS.md): milana-refactor for extraction, milana-feature
  for new behavior; both Codex and Claude use repository-controlled instructions.

## Required checks and open risks

- Follow [verification gates](VERIFICATION.md) after each runtime migration/fix/feature:
  test validity, relevant automated tests, actual visual E2E with screenshot inspection,
  bounded isolated stress, persisted integrity/recovery, then human acceptance.
  Required missing/skipped checks are BLOCKED, not PASS. No production stress/data fabrication.
- Default backend pytest fixtures use SQLite. Real PostgreSQL checks need their
  documented setup/collection; do not infer locking correctness from SQLite success.
- One write path per request and one outer transaction owner. Preserve locks, audit,
  idempotency and side-effect timing. [Retry identity rules](idempotency.md) are active.
- Preserve stable business rules in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). Particular regression
  cases include sewing 600 received -> 495 then 105, independent Nastils, optional
  stages, and validated packaging receipts before finished-goods stock.
- Historical authorization/audit-chain findings are not declared resolved here;
  consult AGENTS.md and the relevant bug/evidence. OPS01/OPS07 still require the
  correlated factory-path evidence described in [performance evidence](performance-evidence.txt).
- CI branch triggering and automatic recovery improvements in the plan remain
  implementation tasks; skills/docs do not install enforcement or rollback.
- Recovery targets in [DISASTER_RECOVERY.md](DISASTER_RECOVERY.md) remain requirements,
  not proof of measured capacity. Preserve backups, active/rollback releases and evidence.

## Latest documentation work

- Shared skill/ownership baseline: f8719d19; verification gates: c1277680.
- Removed superseded developer/review instructions, consolidated backend/docs into
  docs/, archived dated reports and the full old context, and relocated training
  generation tools under scripts/training/. Runtime code, data, tests, deployment
  settings and test-consumed audit baselines remain unchanged.
- Documentation cleanup is not a deployment. See the final task handoff for its
  publication commit; do not infer current production from a documentation commit.
- Obsidian mirror location from AGENTS.md was unavailable during prior planning;
  no mirror synchronization is claimed. Search archived evidence only as needed.
